          Hello There! My name is Victor and thank you for checking out my World
          of Warcraft Checker.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool was designed to be my Senior Project at McKendree University
          in Illinois. It was designed to be a one-stop shop experience for
          World of Warcraft players to be able to check on any player's
          progress.
        </p>
        I hope that this tool can one day become valuable to the World of
        Warcraft Community!
